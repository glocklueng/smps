494_test_generator - a generator of alternating square wave voltage and current.

Useful when debugging a GDT (gate drive transformer) with oscilloscope, as well as an 60Hz-300kHz two channel signal generator with adjustable duty cycle.

Some oscilloscope screenshots are included for 60Hz and 30kHz. The supply voltage was 12V.

Combining it with IR2110 full bridge gives a powerful ferrite transformer tester!
