smps - my switch mode power supply schematics, simulations and drafts for future projects.

This repository contains already implemented things and my future designs that are drafted.
I put these schematics into public domain so anyone can reuse them and build the big good things
that will power their homes, worksites and many many places which require stable good power supplies.
There mostly a step-up things (i.e. power projects which convert battery supply voltage into usable
high voltage), but some are step-down power supplies.

Schematics here are usually simulations that should be run from LTSpice. Some virtual parts are
to be obtained elsewhere, because I have no rights to redistribute them in this repository.

The parts you can obtain are from:

* http://valvolodin.narod.ru/models.html - archives ValVol.zip, parts of Standard.zip, spice.zip, extra.rar, extra_n.rar.
* I hope to continue this list...

*** WARNING! *** Strict repeating of circuit may or MAY NOT lead you to a working unit. Author is NOT responsible for any misuse of provided data. Where possible there will be a "confirmed working" PCB image included (especially for finished projects). If you will repeat it EXACTLY, only then I can help you to debug your issue.

If you experience trouble building supply and have repeated my circuit, be prepared to have following equipment:

* A multimeter, of course. Chinese small DT830 type is enough if it accurate.
* An oscilloscope of enough bandwidth (10MHz and higher), analog or digital
* An LC(R) meter. It's required for measuring inductances accurately. An additional accurate R meter is required if you're using low ohm shunts as a current sensors.
* For high voltages it's good to have a neon phase detector.

Then you can start a conversation with me by mailing me. You can find out my email address by visiting the page: http://lynxlynx.tk/contact/. Please prepend the Subject: line with "[smps]" (without quotes).
