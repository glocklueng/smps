TL494 booster - monitor voltage AND current at the same time.

This is a lame booster I made in software at some day, and later - real hardware version. It is intended to drive a large powerful 30V 20W high voltage LED which sits on a big heatsink and still heats up to 70Â°C! Because many PWM circuits ordered from China are only voltage monitoring devices and do not monitor current, this one is to help.

- If the current is less than 500mA, it will keep 30V steady voltage
- If load sinks more than 500mA, the voltage monitoring is off, and current is monitored constantly at 500mA level.

This circuit forces TL494 to do both voltage and current monitoring. This is achieved by "weighting" the feedback of both error amplifiers. Both error amplifiers are filtered with RC circuits to cut off 100kHz switching.

Circuit characteristics:

- Measured efficiency is about 90%: at 12,6Vin @ 1.31A out is clean 30V 0.5A with IRL3705N MOSFET. With yellow-white toroidal choke it drops to about 85-88% (worst 85% is at high currents with 9V input).
- Working input range is 9-18VDC. To filter output, place a small inductor between two caps. Tested to 20VDC if 18V Zener is installed on MOSFET from gate to source (included on circuit).
- Included PCB is for max. 60W of operation. Circuit scales well, but non transformer nature limits it's power capacity. This circuit is just a education on how to regulate both voltage and current smoothly with TL494. Still good enough for things like small LED drivers, 12-19V for notebooks etc. Just order good coils because sourcing them is difficult.
- I do not think gapless inductor is possible here. So do not expect more than 90% efficiency.
