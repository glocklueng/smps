This circuit is a step-up push-pull rated at 10-14VDC input and 350VDC output.
Ideal power capacity is about 1kW, real one is just under 700W. Efficiency <= 94%.

Notes about LTSpice circuit:

* Input diode to SG3525 is really an UF4007
* 0.0001R resistors from supply to ground are simulated trace resistance
* Snubber diode is really a FR207
